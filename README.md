### Greetings!

I'm Meg. I'm a biostatistician by training who's spent most of the last decade in the public health sphere. It occurred to me that someone down the line might need proof that I can code and analyze things in fancy ways. Hence, here is my GitHub, a testament to how much time I've spent staring at a computer.

Working in public health and medical spaces, I've written a lot of code and results that I can't share publicly (because patient privacy, politics, cat ate my laptop, etc.). But...I can usually talk about them. Here's a list of some things I've done:

#### Highlights:
- Automation of error identification and simple feedback messages in SAS and Python for an electronic lab reporting onboarding process
- Classification of COVID-19 vaccination status based on vaccination dates, dose number, vaccine type, and organizational rules
- Investigating the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination status and employment licensing renewal the next year
- Querying the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) using SQL to obtain data for COVID-19 adverse outcome studies
- Linking and filtering data from multiple years of the National Readmissions Database (NRD) datasets in R and Python
- Uncovering underlying student groups and how they fared in a multistage medical school admissions process (MStat culminating project in R involving latent class analysis, regressions with pairwise comparisons, mixed effects models, and a few other things asides)
- Selecting patient characteristics from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data for a dental hygiene recommendation system using ridge regression
- Building and evaluating various types of machine learning models for predicting dental cavities in Python
